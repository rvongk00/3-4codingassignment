		int [] ages = {3, 9, 23 , 64, 2, 8, 28, 92};
//		a. Programatically subtract the value of the first element in the array from the value in the last element of the array. (i.e. do not use ages [7] in your code). Print the result to the console.
		System.out.println(ages[ages.length-1]-ages[0]);
//      b. Add a new age to your array and repeat the step above to ensure it is dynamic (works for arrays of different lengths).
